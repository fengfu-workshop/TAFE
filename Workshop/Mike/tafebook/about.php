                <h1>About tafebook</h1>

                <p><img class="pull-right" src="images/tafebook-logo-small.png" alt="tafebook logo" width="400" height="89" /><em>tafebook</em> is the social network for TAFE students.</p>

                <p><em>tafebook</em> was started in 1923 by a group of highly-socially-conscious, technically-savvy, young go getters. They knew that no system existed to join together the TAFE students of Australia to stay social and interactive with their fellow students.</p>

                <p>The system was developed to help current students and alumni stay in touch with each other for both personal and professional networking opportunities. Clearly, <em>tafebook</em> has been around for several decades before both Facebook and LinkedIn, making it the original and the best social networking system - but it's only available to TAFE students!</p>
